Hi! My name is **Bert Jehoul** aka **jeborsel**.  
I work as civil servant for **FOD BOSA DG Digital Transformation** on **Innovation** projects. Convinced of the power of openess to reduce bureaucracy, increase trust & facilitate citizen-engagement and private-public coöperations, I am an enthusiastic volunteer & **board member of Open Knowledge Belgium**.  
As active member of the international **Open Badges & Open Recognition** community I helped initiating the [Be Badges platform at Selor](https://client.selor.be/nl/nieuws/2016/12/e-gov-award-%E2%80%98innovatie%E2%80%99-voor-be-badges,-het-open-talentplatform-van-selor/) (Selection Office for the Belgian Government), support the [Bologna Open Recognition Declaration](https://www.openrecognition.org/bord/) and co-founded [Open Recognition Belgium](http://openrecognition.be/).
I've been involved in multiple Erasmus+ projects & European expert groups on Open Badges & Open Recognition and did talks and workshops at [Open Belgium](http://openbelgium.be/), [ePIC](https://epic.openrecognition.org/), [HackBelgium](https://www.hackbelgium.be/) , etc...
and co-organise [Civic Lab Brussels](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Civic-Lab-Brussels/) & [Basic Income Tech](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Belgium-Basic-Income-Meetup/) meetups.

I have a background in **Psychology and Psychometrics** and learned some coding via the use of the **statistical software R**.
I very much enjoy coaching students each year during [Open Summer of Code](https://osoc.be/).  

As a freelancer I am a part of the [RD Talents](https://www.rdtalents.eu/) Open Badges consultants network and one of the co-founders of [BitofTrust](https://www.bitoftrust.com/the-founding-members/about-bit-of-trust/), a French Start-up grown out of the Open Badges community to build the tooling needed to go from Open Badges to Open Recognition.
