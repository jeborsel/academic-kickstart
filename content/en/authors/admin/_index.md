Hi! My name is **Bert Jehoul**, online you can find me as **jeborsel**.  

Currently I work as Innovation Designer at the FPS BOSA [**FPS BOSA**](https://bosa.belgium.be). For which I am helping to implement Conversational AI to improve the delivery of public services and enhance the citizen experience.

As volunteer I am an active member of the international [**Open Badges**](https://openbadges.org/) **&** [**Open Recognition**](https://openrecognition.org/) community and co-founder of [Open Recognition Belgium](https://openknowledge.be/activities/open-recognition-belgium). 
I am also an enthusiastic volunteer & member of the board of [**Open Knowledge Belgium**](http://openknowledge.be/) for which I was co-organiser of [Civic Lab Brussels](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Civic-Lab-Brussels/) & [Basic Income Tech](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Belgium-Basic-Income-Meetup/) meetups.

I have a background in **Psychology and Psychometrics** and learned coding via the use of the **statistical software R**.
I am a former coach at [Open Summer of Code](https://osoc.be/).
