Hi! My name is **Bert Jehoul**, online you can find me as **jeborsel**.  

Currently working as Independent on [**Open Badges**](https://openbadges.org/) & European projects on [Open Recognition](https://openrecognition.org/).

I am an active member of the international **Open Badges & Open Recognition** community and co-founder of [Open Recognition Belgium](https://openknowledge.be/activities/open-recognition-belgium). 
I am also an enthusiastic volunteer & member of the board of [**Open Knowledge Belgium**](http://openknowledge.be/) and co-organiser of [Civic Lab Brussels](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Civic-Lab-Brussels/) & [Basic Income Tech](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Belgium-Basic-Income-Meetup/) meetups.

As Independent I am a part of the [RD Talents](https://www.rdtalents.eu/) Open Badges consultants network and one of the co-founders of [BitofTrust](https://www.bitoftrust.com/the-founding-members/about-bit-of-trust/).

I have a background in **Psychology and Psychometrics** and learned coding via the use of the **statistical software R**.
I very much enjoy coaching students each year during [Open Summer of Code](https://osoc.be/).
